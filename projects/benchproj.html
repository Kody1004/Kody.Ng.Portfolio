            <h1>Bench Project</h1>
            <p>At school, my group and I was given a task to innovate on a product. My group and I decided to make this bench. The bench can rotate allowing people to sit on a clean side when the other is wet, dirty, etc. 
            This was made on AutoDesk Inventor and took about 2 weeks to design and create.</p>

                    <h1>Step 1:</h1>
                    <p>I first started by creating the different parts of the bench. I started with the seat and the legs. For the seat, I started with a rectangular prism and fileted the sides
                        to create rounded edges. Then to create the hole in the center, I originally started with a circular hole but I later realized that a circular hole
                        wouldn't hold up when rotating so I changed it to a rectangular hole.

                <h1>Step 2:</h1>
                <p>After creating the bench seat, I created the legs of the bench. The legs of the bench were easier I started with rectangles to create the basic shape and then used the filet commands
                        to create the rounded edges. I then created a hole in the middle, allowing the crank to fit. I also was able to change the materials of each part. The bench would be made out of oak wood while the legs would be
                        made out of steel.

                    <h1>Step 3:</h1>
                    <p> Next, I created the crank. The crank had to had to be rectangular in the center but circular on the outer edges. I first created the handle. The handle 
                        was made with tapered extrusions that allowed the protruding handle. This led to a sweep for the curvature of the curve of the crank to connect it from a circular
                        shape to a rectangular shape. I then extruded the rectangular shape halfway. Then I was able to mirror it across and create the whole part. I then made this part from PC/ABS plastic as it has really high
                        toughness and strength impact which is great for a part like this. This part was really interesting because of the many different ways you could've created it and 
                        my group members, each had their own way of creating the crank.

                    <h1>Step 4:</h1>
                    <p>After creating all the parts, I then began to assemble them. I used the axis I created through the hole in the bench to line everything up first. 
                        Then, I used the sides of the bench and mated it to the sides of the bench. However, I realized that the bench wouldn't 
                        be able to stop and if someone sat on it, then the bench would continue to rotate. This led me to create holes on the legs for door stoppers. The idea 
                    for the door stoppers would be something that could slide in and out. </p>

                <h1>Step 5:</h1>
                <p>
                    I then created the door stoppers. I had to use the dimensions that I cut the hole out with to make the door stopper. 
                    I originally started with a rectangular prism and extruded it towards a cylinder. The cylinder top is meant to top the bench
                    from rotating too much. It also has the rectangle at the end for it for the user to hold onto and push. To add this to the assembly, 
                    we created a minimum and maximum flush constraint which allowed the door stopper to slide to both sides.

                <h1>Step 6:</h1>
                    <p>
                        I then also created a cover for the bench as even though the purpose of the bench was that it could rotate after getting dirty, a cover should be there 
                        so the bench doesn't have to be rotated as much. I started with the dimensions of the bench and was able to make a perpendicular line from the top. This allowed 
                        me to filet the corner and create the curve on the top of the corner. I thought this cover would be connected to the two legs which doesn't 
                        stop the bench from rotating. 
                    </p>

            <div class="text">
                <h1>Final Step:</h1>
                <p>After creating all the parts, I finally finished assembling everything. There were some problems with the cover but 
                    I was able to fix it after changing the order of the constraints. In addition, I added the door stoppers into the assembly
                    and was able to create a contact set that didn't allow the bench to go past the cylinder. I was happy with the product because I 
                    was able to create something that I thought innovated on a previous product and improved it.
