        <p>Currently, I am a high school senior at Staten Island Technical High School in Staten Island, NY where I'm studying many subjects and preparing to go to college. 
        I am a person with many interests. Since I was a kid, I've always been interested in cars and aerospace. 
        As I grew up, I started to learn more things like coding and 3D modeling. I was able to learn
        Java, Python, HTML, Javascript, and CSS as well as learning Autodesk Inventor, Fusion360, and AutoCAD. My learning is all reflected in this website. Because of these interests,
        I aspire to become a mechanical engineer where I can work on projects that interest me. I dream to be able to work on F1 cars. 
        In addition to those academic endeavors, I also love to play hockey where I play on a national schedule. Hockey has been a huge part of my life since
        I was 5 and I've been able to experience events such as New York States Final and the pinnacle, USA Hockey National Championships. 
        When I'm not doing all that, I enjoy playing videogames and hanging out with friends. </p>
